# Rainwater Quality System

This repository is the entire program code used to complete the real-time rainwater quality measurement system research project. In this repository there are three files, namely:

1. Data validation, used to validate raw measurement data so that the measurement data to be analyzed is clean data. The programming language used is Python.
2. Microcontroller, used as a regulator for the operation of the measurement system so that the system can run as desired. The programming language used is C.
3. Internet of Things (IoT), used to send measurement data to the Internet of Things (IoT) platform in real-time. In this project, the Internet of Things (IoT) platform used is the Thingspeak platform. The language used is C.

## Installation

1. Clone this project:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/achmadfaizalawi/rainwater-quality-system.git
